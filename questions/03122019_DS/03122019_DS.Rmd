### Question

Suppose there are two disjoint events A and B. Each of them has positive probability. What can you say about independence of A and B?

  1. Both are independent
  2. They are not independent
  3. Can't say anything

### Answer

Two events are said to be independent if
$$P(A \cap B) = P(A)P(B)$$
In the case of disjoint events:
$$P(A \cap B) = P(\phi) = 0$$ where $\phi$ is null set.

Whereas: 
$$P(A)P(B) > 0$$

So, $P(A \cap B) \ne P(A)P(B)$. Hence they are not independent.
