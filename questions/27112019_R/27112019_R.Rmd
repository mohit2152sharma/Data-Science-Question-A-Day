### Question

Which of the following is valid for subsetting column `cyl` from the `mtcars` dataset?

  1. mtcars$cyl
  2. `$`(mtcars, cyl)
  3. mtcars[['cyl']]
  4. All of the above

### Answer

All of the above options are correct. R provides three operators for subsetting `[[`, `[`, `$`. `mtcars$cyl` is equivalent to `mtcars[['cyl']]`, but not to `mtcars['cyl']`, as the latter one produces output of different class compared to former one. `mtcars['cyl']` will give dataframe as a output whereas `mtcars$cyl` will give numeric vector as an output.

These operators can be called as function also.
```{r}
`$`(mtcars, cyl)
`[[`(mtcars, 'cyl')
`[`(mtcars, 'cyl')
```
