### Question
I have a linear model. I add a feature to the model and retrain it. 

  1. If $R^2$ increases, feature is significant
  2. If $R^2$ decreases, feature is not significant
  3. Can't say anything about significance with $R^2$

### Answer

We can't comment on significance of a feature with $R^2$. The $R^2$ is bound to increase (except collinear features, where it stays the same) as we add more and more features. 

The significance of a feature can be interpreted from it's p value, the lower the p value, the more significant it is.
