### Question

A medical test for disease D has outcome positive or negative with following probabilities. Suppose you go for a test and get a positive. What is the probability that you have a disease?

Source: All of Statistics by Larry A. Wasserman

```{r, echo=FALSE}

data.frame('Disease' = c(0.0081, 0.009),
           'No Disease' = c(0.09, 0.9010),
           row.names = c('positive', 'negative'))

```


### Answer

From conditional probability:

$$P(Disease|positive) = \frac {P(positive \cap Disease)} {P(positive)}$$
$$P(Disease|positive) = \frac {0.0081}{0.0081+0.090}$$
$$P(Disease|positive) \approx 0.08$$
