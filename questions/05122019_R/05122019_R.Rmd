### Question

Given the following CDFs plot, what can you say about normal distributions: $y_1$, $y_2$, $y_3$?

  1. $\mu_1$ > $\mu_2$ > $\mu_3$
  2. $\mu_1$ < $\mu_2$ < $\mu_3$

```{r, echo=FALSE,warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(ggthemr)
library(latex2exp)

x = seq(-10,10, length.out = 1000)
y1 = pnorm(x, mean = -2, sd = 4)
y2 = pnorm(x, mean = 0, sd = 1)
y3 = pnorm(x, mean = 2, sd= 2.5)
df = tibble(x,y1,y2,y3)
cols = c('y1' = 'black', 'y2' = 'orange', 'y3' = 'blue')

labels = data.frame(x = c(-3,-1.5,3), y=c(0.5,0.25,0.5), text = c('y1', 'y2', 'y3'))
ggthemr('dust')
ggplot(df, aes(x)) +
  geom_line(aes(y=y1, color='y1')) +
  geom_line(aes(y=y2, color='y2')) +
  geom_line(aes(y=y3, color='y3')) +
  geom_text(data = labels, aes(label=text, x= x, y= y)) +
  theme(legend.position = 'None') + 
  labs(x =TeX("$x$"), y = TeX("$F_x(x)$"), title='CDFs')

```

### Answer
$\mu_1$ < $\mu_2$ < $\mu_3$ is correct. 
As for the CDFs of normal distributions, the curve is bounded between 0 and 1, as the $\sigma$ increases the curve becomes more and more flat (towards x axis) and as the $\mu$ increases the curve shifts more and more towards right.
