### Question
You have one dollar and a fair coin. If you get head, your position doubles but if you get tail, your position halves. What is the expected value of money after first toss?

  1. 5/4
  2. 1
  3. None
  
### Answer
Expectation for a discrete event is defined as:
$$\begin{aligned}
E(X) &= \sum_{all x} x*p(x) \\
&= \frac {1}{2}*2 + \frac {1}{2} *\frac {1}{2} \\
&= \frac {5}{4}
\end{aligned}
$$
