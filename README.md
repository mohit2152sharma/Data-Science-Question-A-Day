Accompanying repository of the twitter account [data science question a day](https://twitter.com/data_question). This is a social experiment to teach about data science using twitter. Every day a question is posted on the account related to datas science with options in poll format. The answer to the question is posted next day, mostly after 12-14 hours.

You can use the following links to access the questions and answers and if you like my work you can support it by <a href='https://www.buymeacoffee.com/NgFs2zX'>buying a coffee</a>
